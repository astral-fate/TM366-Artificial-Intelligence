## Overview

In this unit, you will learn about neural networks, which are artificial systems that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are able to recognize patterns, classify stimuli, and select appropriate responses, similar to how the human brain does. They consist of special cells called <b>neurons</b>, which communicate with each other through junctions called synapses. The nervous system can be divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS consists of all other nerves. Neural networks can be arranged in different topologies, including feedforward, lattice, and recurrent. They can be trained using <b> learning rules </b>, which adjust the weights of the connections between units based on the input data and the

# Biological background of the nervous system

A neuron is a cell that is specialized for transmitting information in the nervous system. It has several parts, including the cell body, dendrites, axon, and terminal buttons. A synapse is a junction between two neurons, through which one neuron can communicate with another by releasing chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.

When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, it generates an action potential, which is a sudden change in the electrical charge of the cell membrane. This is caused by the movement of ions, such as sodium and potassium, through ion channels in the membrane. The action potential travels down the axon of the neuron and is transmitted to other neurons through the synapse.

At a synapse, the action potential causes the release of neurotransmitters, which bind to receptors on the receiving neuron and either excite or inhibit it. This process is called neurotransmission. Long-term potentiation is a process by which the strength of a synapse is increased, resulting in more efficient communication between neurons.

## Neural network in deep learning 

In an artificial neural network, units are the basic processing elements that perform computation based on the input data and weights. The input function determines how the input data is processed before it is passed to the units. The activation function is a mathematical function that determines the output of the units based on their inputs and weights. Weights are values that determine the strength of the connections between units. Different topologies can be used to arrange the units and weights in an artificial neural network, such as feedforward, lattice, and recurrent.

#  Learning Rules

A learning rule is a set of instructions that determines how the weights of a neural network should be adjusted based on the input data and the desired output. For example, 
* The backpropagation algorithm: <br>
is a learning rule that adjusts the weights based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output. Mathematical representations, such as signal graphs, sigma notation, and vector/matrix notation, can be used to represent and analyze neural network concepts.
