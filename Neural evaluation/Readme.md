## Chapter objectives 

* Describe some characteristics of natural intelligence, including recognition, classification, response, and learning.
* Label diagrams of a neuron and a synapse with the names of their constituent parts.
* Explain the process by which a neuron generates an action potential, including the role of the cell membrane and ion channels.
* Describe the action of a synapse and the phenomenon of long-term potentiation.
* Explain the role of units, input functions, activation functions, and weights in an artificial neural network.
* Use diagrams to explain how units and weights can be combined in various topologies to form an artificial neural network.
* Describe the concept of a learning rule in detail, including an example.
* Use mathematical representations, including signal graphs, sigma notation, and vector/matrix notation, to explain neural network concepts.
