## Study noted


Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a type of computational technique that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. GAs work by simulating the process of natural evolution to find the optimal solution to a problem.



# Darwin Vs. Lamarck


 3 principles of the Darwinian evolution.
- Organisms vary.
- Organisms produce more offspring than the environment could possibly support.
- Members of species struggle among themselves, and with other species, for the limited
      resources available in the environment.
# Optimial selection problems 

One type of problem that can be solved using GAs is the roulette wheel problem, which involves finding the optimal selection of items from a set of options. For example, suppose you have a set of items with different weights and values, and you want to select a subset of items that maximizes the total value while staying within a certain weight limit. You could use a GA to find the optimal selection of items by representing each selection as a chromosome and evolving the chromosomes through a process of selection, crossover, and mutation. <br>

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are computational techniques that are inspired by the process of natural evolution and the concept of survival of the fittest. They involve the creation of a population of potential solutions to a problem, represented as genomes, which are strings of bits representing possible solutions. A separate program, called a fitness function, is used to evaluate each genome based on its suitability as a solution, and assign it a place on the fitness landscape, which is the space of all possible solutions with the best solutions at the peaks and the worst at the valleys.

GAs introduce diversity into the population through the use of mutation, which refers to changes made to an organism's genes. These changes can be caused by errors in DNA replication, radiation, chemicals, or other environmental factors. Beneficial mutations give the organism a better chance of survival and reproduction, and over time, these mutations can accumulate in the population, leading to evolution.

The process of reproduction in living organisms involves the shuffling of genetic information through the exchange of genetic material during meiosis, the formation of gametes with only one of each pair of chromosomes, and the fusion of these gametes to form a zygote with the full complement of chromosomes. GAs mimic this process through a three-step process: generating a mating pool, creating a new population, and repeating these steps until a satisfactory solution is found or a predefined termination condition is met.

An example of a GA might be finding the maximum score possible from rolling two dice. In this case, the genomes would represent the values of the two dice, and the fitness function would simply add the values of the dice to determine the fitness of each genome. The genomes are then ranked based on their fitness values, and the fittest genomes are selected to form the mating pool.

To create the next generation, the GAs use crossover and reproduction operators to combine the genetic information of the genomes in the mating pool. Crossover involves the exchange of genetic material between two genomes to create a new genome, while reproduction involves the replication of a genome without any changes. These new genomes form the next generation, and the process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found or the termination condition is met.

GAs have been applied to a wide range of problems, such as optimization, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and have proven to be effective in finding solutions to complex problems.
