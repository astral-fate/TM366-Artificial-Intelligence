## Intro-Inference
## Search

This unit introduced Informed search or heuristic search. 
Uniformed search, or blind search. Then it explores Search algorithms like
Brute-Force algorithms like Breadth-First search, Breadth-Best Search, Depth-First Search, and A* Search.
For a visulization for these algorithms, you can refer to:

Breadth-first search
Depth first search
Best search

## Game tree and graph pruning

Min-Max, stone game
## Blocks world and Rejecting symbolic AI

OnTable(a,b), HandsEmpty()
## AI-inspiration

The natural intelligence and animals
## ACO and PSO
Example of natural intelligence is:
Ant Colony optomization
## Neural evaluation
## Learning perceptron and delta
## Backprop and competitive
## GA algorithm
