## Intro-Inference
## Search

This unit introduced Informed search or heuristic search. 
Uniformed search, or blind search. Then it explores Search algorithms like
Brute-Force algorithms like Breadth-First search, Breadth-Best Search, Depth-First Search, and A* Search
for a visulization for the algorithms, you can refer to:
