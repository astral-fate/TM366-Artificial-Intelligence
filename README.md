## Intro-Inference
## Search

This unit introduced Informed search or heuristic search. 
Uniformed search, or blind search. Then it explores Search algorithms like
Brute-Force algorithms like Breadth-First search, Breadth-Best Search, Depth-First Search, and A* Search.
For a visulization for these algorithms, you can refer to:

Breadth-first search <br>
Depth first search <br>
Best search <br>
A*


## Game tree and graph pruning

using Min-Max with games such as:
Tic Tac Toe
Stone game


## Blocks world and Rejecting symbolic AI

OnTable(a,b), HandsEmpty()
## AI-inspiration

The natural intelligence and animals; inspired by ants, and birds' swarm
## ACO and PSO
Example of natural intelligence is:
Ant Colony optomization ACO <br>
Practical swarm optimization PSO
## Neural evaluation
## Learning perceptron and delta
## Backprop and competitive
## GA algorithm
## GA operators
## RL-Robotics
