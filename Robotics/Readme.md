## Study Notes
Robotics is the field of engineering that focuses on the design and development of robots. These are physical agents that can perform tasks by manipulating the physical world through the use of effectors such as legs, wheels, joints, and grippers. Effectors are designed to exert physical forces on the environment and allow robots to interact with it.

Robots are also equipped with sensors, which allow them to perceive their environment and gather information about it. These sensors can include cameras and lasers for measuring the environment, and gyroscopes and accelerometers for measuring the robot's own motion.

There are three main categories of robots: <br>
* manipulators <br>
        Manipulators, or robot arms, are anchored to a specific workplace and use a chain of controllable joints to move their effectors to any position within that           workplace. They are commonly used in industrial settings, including car manufacturing and assembly lines, and some are even used in surgical procedures.               Mobile robots,
*  mobile robots  <br>
          move around their environment using wheels, legs, or other mechanisms and can be used for tasks such as delivering food in hospitals and moving containers             at loading docks.

*  mobile manipulators  <br>
          Mobile manipulators are a combination of both, combining mobility with manipulation capabilities.

Real robots must be able to cope with complex and dynamic environments that are often partially observable, stochastic, and continuous. They also often operate in sequential and multiagent environments. To navigate these environments, robots are equipped with a variety of sensors, including passive sensors like cameras and active sensors like sonar. Range finders, such as GPS, are used to determine the location of the robot, while tactile sensors like whiskers and touch-sensitive skin allow the robot to sense objects in close proximity.

In order to make decisions and perform tasks, robots rely on control systems that process the data gathered by their sensors. These control systems can range from simple rule-based systems to more complex machine learning algorithms. The design and implementation of these control systems is a key aspect of robotics engineering.

Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial manufacturing to search and rescue missions, and their capabilities are constantly expanding as technology advances. They have the potential to revolutionize many industries and have the potential to greatly impact our daily lives.
In addition to the hardware components mentioned earlier, there are several software components that are essential for robots to function effectively. These include:

Robot operating system (ROS): This is a software framework that provides common services and tools for robot software development. It is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing developers to easily create and modify robot applications.

<b>Motion planning algorithms<b>: These are used to generate paths for the robot to follow, taking into account the robot's physical constraints and the environment it is operating in. Motion planning algorithms can be used for tasks such as navigating to a specific location or avoiding obstacles.

<b> Control algorithms<b>: These algorithms are used to control the robot's actuators (the hardware components that produce motion) and ensure that the robot follows the desired path. Control algorithms can be simple rule-based systems or more complex machine learning algorithms.

Machine learning algorithms: These algorithms allow robots to learn from experience and improve their performance over time. They are often used for tasks such as object recognition, where the robot needs to identify and classify objects based on sensory data.

Robotics is a rapidly evolving field with numerous applications in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. As robots become more advanced and sophisticated, they will continue to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives.


# GPS vs. differential GPS

GPS vs. differential GPS: GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite-based navigation system that measures the distance to satellites emitting pulsed signals. It is used to determine the location of a GPS receiver on Earth. Differential GPS (DGPS) involves a second ground receiver with a known location, which is used to improve the accuracy of the location measurement. DGPS can achieve higher accuracy than GPS alone, but it requires the use of additional hardware and may be subject to interference or other errors.
