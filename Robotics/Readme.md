## Study Notes
Robotics is the field of engineering that focuses on the design and development of robots. These are physical agents that can perform tasks by manipulating the physical world through the use of effectors such as legs, wheels, joints, and grippers. Effectors are designed to exert physical forces on the environment and allow robots to interact with it.

Robots are also equipped with sensors, which allow them to perceive their environment and gather information about it. These sensors can include cameras and lasers for measuring the environment, and gyroscopes and accelerometers for measuring the robot's own motion.

There are three main categories of robots: <br>
* manipulators <br>
        Manipulators, or robot arms, are anchored to a specific workplace and use a chain of controllable joints to move their effectors to any position within that           workplace. They are commonly used in industrial settings, including car manufacturing and assembly lines, and some are even used in surgical procedures.               Mobile robots,
*  mobile robots  <br>
          move around their environment using wheels, legs, or other mechanisms and can be used for tasks such as delivering food in hospitals and moving containers             at loading docks.

*  mobile manipulators  <br>
          Mobile manipulators are a combination of both, combining mobility with manipulation capabilities.


# Types of Robotics hardware components and sensors:

* Range finders: <br>
Range finders are sensors that measure the distance to nearby objects. They can be active or passive, and there are several different types of range finders, including laser range finders, ultrasonic range finders, and radar range finders. Range finders are used in a variety of applications, including robotics, surveying, and self-driving vehicles.

* Passive sensors: <br>
Passive sensors are sensors that do not emit any energy into the environment and simply observe the signals that are generated by other sources. Examples of passive sensors include cameras, microphones, and thermometers. Passive sensors are used in a variety of applications, including robotics, security systems, and environmental monitoring.

* Tactile sensors: <br>
Tactile sensors are sensors that measure physical contact and are used to detect the presence, position, and shape of objects. Examples of tactile sensors include whiskers, bump panels, and touch-sensitive skin. Tactile sensors are used in robotics, prosthetics, and other applications where the ability to detect and respond to touch is important



Real robots must be able to cope with complex and dynamic environments that are often partially observable, stochastic, and continuous. They also often operate in sequential and multiagent environments. To navigate these environments, robots are equipped with a variety of sensors, including passive sensors like cameras and active sensors like sonar. Range finders, such as GPS, are used to determine the location of the robot, while tactile sensors like whiskers and touch-sensitive skin allow the robot to sense objects in close proximity.

In order to make decisions and perform tasks, robots rely on control systems that process the data gathered by their sensors. These control systems can range from simple rule-based systems to more complex machine learning algorithms. The design and implementation of these control systems is a key aspect of robotics engineering.

##  GPS vs. differential GPS

GPS vs. differential GPS: GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite-based navigation system that measures the distance to satellites emitting pulsed signals. It is used to determine the location of a GPS receiver on Earth. Differential GPS (DGPS) involves a second ground receiver with a known location, which is used to improve the accuracy of the location measurement. DGPS can achieve higher accuracy than GPS alone, but it requires the use of additional hardware and may be subject to interference or other errors.


#  Robotics software components:

* Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial manufacturing to search and rescue missions, and their capabilities are constantly expanding as technology advances. They have the potential to revolutionize many industries and have the potential to greatly impact our daily lives.
In addition to the hardware components mentioned earlier, there are several software components that are essential for robots to function effectively. These include:

* Robot Operating System (ROS):  <br> 
ROS is an open-source software platform that is widely used in robotics research and development. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building robotic applications, including libraries for communication, perception, and control. ROS is designed to be modular and scalable, and it is used in a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, service robots, and manufacturing.

* Motion planning algorithms: Motion planning algorithms are algorithms that are used to plan the motion of a robot or other system through an environment. These algorithms take into account the robot's kinematics and dynamics, as well as the constraints and obstacles in the environment, in order to generate a feasible and efficient motion plan. Motion planning algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including robotics, manufacturing, and animation.

* Control algorithms: <br> 
Control algorithms are algorithms that are used to control the behavior of a system, such as a robot. These algorithms take in sensor data and use it to compute control signals that are sent to the system's actuators in order to achieve a desired behavior or performance. Control algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including robotics, aerospace, and manufacturing.

* Machine learning algorithms:  <br> 
Machine learning algorithms are algorithms that are used to learn patterns and relationships in data. These algorithms can be used to make predictions, classify data, or identify trends. There are many different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Machine learning algorithms are used in a variety of applications, including robotics, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.






Robotics is a rapidly evolving field with numerous applications in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. As robots become more advanced and sophisticated, they will continue to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives.
